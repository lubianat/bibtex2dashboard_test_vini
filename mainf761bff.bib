abstract = {In scientific workflows, provenance data helps scientists in understanding, evaluating and reproducing their results. Provenance data generated at runtime can also support workflow steering mechanisms. Steering facilities for workflows is considered a challenge due to its dynamic demands during execution. To steer, for example, scientists should be able to suspend (or stop) a workflow execution when the approximate solution meets (or deviates) preset criteria. These criteria are commonly evaluated based on provenance data (execution data) and domain-specific data. We claim that the final decision on whether to interfere on the workflow execution may only become feasible when workflows can be steered by scientists using provenance data enriched with domain-specific data. In this paper we propose an approach based on specialized software components, named Data Extractor (DE), to acquire domain-specific data from data files produced during a scientific workflow execution. DE gathers domain-specific data from produced data files and associates it to existing provenance data on the provenance repository. We have evaluated the proposed approach using a real bioinformatics workflow for comparative genomics executed in SciCumulus cloud workflow parallel engine. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Provenance is information about entities, activities, and people involved in producing a piece of data or thing, which can be used to form assessments about its quality, reliability or trustworthiness. PROV-DM is the conceptual data model that forms a basis for the W3C provenance (PROV) family of specifications. PROV-DM distinguishes core structures, forming the essence of provenance information, from extended structures catering for more specific uses of provenance. PROV-DM is organized in six components, respectively dealing with: (1) entities and activities, and the time at which they were created, used, or ended; (2) derivations of entities from entities; (3) agents bearing responsibility for entities that were generated and activities that happened; (4) a notion of bundle, a mechanism to support provenance of provenance; (5) properties to link entities that refer to the same thing; and, (6) collections forming a logical structure for its members. This document introduces the provenance concepts found in PROV and defines PROV-DM types and relations. The PROV data model is domain-agnostic, but is equipped with extensibility points allowing domain-specific information to be included. Two further documents complete the specification of PROV-DM. First, a companion document specifies the set of constraints that provenance should follow. Second, a separate document describes a provenance notation for expressing instances of provenance for human consumption; this notation is used in examples in this document.},

abstract = {Trusted benchmarks should provide reproducible results obtained following a transparent and well-defined process. In this paper, we show how Containers, originally developed to ease the automated deployment of Cloud application components, can be used in the context of a benchmarking methodology. The proposed methodology focuses on Workflow Management Systems (WfMSs), a critical service orchestration middleware, which can be characterized by its architectural complexity, for which Docker Containers offer a highly suitable approach. The contributions of our work are: 1) a new benchmarking approach taking full advantage of containerization technologies; and 2) the formalization of the interaction process with the WfMS vendors described clearly in a written agreement. Thus, we take advantage of emerging Cloud technologies to address technical challenges, ensuring the performance measurements can be trusted. We also make the benchmarking process transparent, automated, and repeatable so that WfMS vendors can join the benchmarking effort.},

@article{Kanwal2017,
abstract = {Background: Computational bioinformatics workflows are extensively used to analyse genomics data, with different approaches available to support implementation and execution of these workflows. Reproducibility is one of the core principles for any scientific workflow and remains a challenge, which is not fully addressed. This is due to incomplete understanding of reproducibility requirements and assumptions of workflow definition approaches. Provenance information should be tracked and used to capture all these requirements supporting reusability of existing workflows. Results: We have implemented a complex but widely deployed bioinformatics workflow using three representative approaches to workflow definition and execution. Through implementation, we identified assumptions implicit in these approaches that ultimately produce insufficient documentation of workflow requirements resulting in failed execution of the workflow. This study proposes a set of recommendations that aims to mitigate these assumptions and guides the scientific community to accomplish reproducible science, hence addressing reproducibility crisis. Conclusions: Reproducing, adapting or even repeating a bioinformatics workflow in any environment requires substantial technical knowledge of the workflow execution environment, resolving analysis assumptions and rigorous compliance with reproducibility requirements. Towards these goals, we propose conclusive recommendations that along with an explicit declaration of workflow specification would result in enhanced reproducibility of computational genomic analyses.},

Docker containers are emerging as a possible solution for many of these problems, as they allow the packaging of pipelines in an isolated and self-contained manner. This makes it easy to distribute and execute pipelines in a portable manner across a wide range of computing platforms. Thus, the question that arises is to what extent the use of Docker containers might affect the performance of these pipelines. Here we address this question and conclude that Docker containers have only a minor impact on the performance of common genomic pipelines, which is negligible when the executed jobs are long in terms of computational time.},

abstract = {Background: The complex nature of biological data has driven the development of specialized software tools. Scientific workflow management systems simplify the assembly of such tools into pipelines, assist with job automation, and aid reproducibility of analyses. Many contemporary workflow tools are specialized or not designed for highly complex workflows, such as with nested loops, dynamic scheduling, and parametrization, which is common in, e.g., machine learning. Findings: SciPipe is a workflow programming library implemented in the programming language Go, for managing complex and dynamic pipelines in bioinformatics, cheminformatics, and other fields. SciPipe helps in particular with workflow constructs common in machine learning, such as extensive branching, parameter sweeps, and dynamic scheduling and parametrization of downstream tasks. SciPipe builds on flow-based programming principles to support agile development of workflows based on a library of self-contained, reusable components. It supports running subsets of workflows for improved iterative development and provides a data-centric audit logging feature that saves a full audit trace for every output file of a workflow, which can be converted to other formats such as HTML, TeX, and PDF on demand. The utility of SciPipe is demonstrated with a machine learning pipeline, a genomics, and a transcriptomics pipeline. Conclusions: SciPipe provides a solution for agile development of complex and dynamic pipelines, especially in machine learning, through a flexible application programming interface suitable for scientists used to programming or scripting.},

abstract = {In spite of over two decades of intense research, illumination and pose invariance remain prohibitively challenging aspects of face recognition for most practical applications. The objective of this work is to recognize faces using video sequences both for training and recognition input, in a realistic, unconstrained setup in which lighting, pose and user motion pattern have a wide variability and face images are of low resolution. The central contribution is an illumination invariant, which we show to be suitable for recognition from video of loosely constrained head motion. In particular there are three contributions: (i) we show how a photometric model of image formation can be combined with a statistical model of generic face appearance variation to exploit the proposed invariant and generalize in the presence of extreme illumination changes; (ii) we introduce a video sequence re-illumination algorithm to achieve fine alignment of two video sequences; and (iii) we use the smoothness of geodesically local appearance manifold structure and a robust same-identity likelihood to achieve robustness to unseen head poses. We describe a fully automatic recognition system based on the proposed method and an extensive evaluation on 323 individuals and 1474 video sequences with extreme illumination, pose and head motion variation. Our system consistently achieved a nearly perfect recognition rate (over 99.7{\%} on all four databases). ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Genomics is a Big Data science and is going to get much bigger, very soon, but it is not known whether the needs of genomics will exceed other Big Data domains. Projecting to the year 2025, we compared genomics with three other major generators of Big Data: astronomy, YouTube, and Twitter. Our estimates show that genomics is a “four-headed beast”—it is either on par with or the most demanding of the domains analyzed here in terms of data acquisition, storage, distribution, and analysis. We discuss aspects of new technologies that will need to be developed to rise up and meet the computational challenges that genomics poses for the near future. Now is the time for concerted, communitywide planning for the “genomical” challenges of the next decade.},

Open data and open-source software have enabled the rapid implementation of novel methods to manage and analyze the growing flood of data. However, it has become apparent that many scientific fields exhibit distressingly low rates of reproducibility. Although there are many dimensions to this issue, we believe that there is a lack of formalism used when describing end-to-end published results, from the data source to the analysis to the final published results. Even when authors do their best to make their research and data accessible, this lack of formalism reduces the clarity and efficiency of reporting, which contributes to issues of reproducibility. Data provenance aids both reproducibility through systematic and formal records of the relationships among data sources, processes, datasets, publications and researchers. Reproducibility},

abstract = {Science is conducted collaboratively, often requiring the sharing of knowledge about computational experiments. When experiments include only datasets, they can be shared using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) or Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). An experiment, however, seldom includes only datasets, but more often includes software, its past execution, provenance, and associated documentation. The Research Object has recently emerged as a comprehensive and systematic method for aggregation and identification of diverse elements of computational experiments. While a necessary method, mere aggregation is not sufficient for the sharing of computational experiments. Other users must be able to easily recompute on these shared research objects. Computational provenance is often the key to enable such reuse. In this paper, we show how reusable research objects can utilize provenance to correctly repeat a previous reference execution, to construct a subset of a research object for partial reuse, and to reuse existing contents of a research object for modified reuse. We describe two methods to summarize provenance that aid in understanding the contents and past executions of a research object. The first method obtains a process-view by collapsing low-level system information, and the second method obtains a summary graph by grouping related nodes and edges with the goal to obtain a graph view similar to application workflow. Through detailed experiments, we show the efficacy and efficiency of our algorithms.},

Recording of the provenance of an experiment-what was done; where, how and why, etc. is an important aspect of scientific best practice that should be extended to in silico experimentation. We will do this in the context of eScience which has been part of the move of bioinformatics towards an industrial setting. Despite the computational nature of bioinformatics, these analyses are scientific and thus necessitate their own versions of typical scientific rigour. Just as recording who, what, why, when, where and how of an experiment is central to the scientific process in laboratory science, so it should be in silico science. The generation and recording of these aspects, or provenance, of an experiment are necessary knowledge management goals if we are to introduce scientific rigour into routine bioinformatics. In Silico experimental protocols should themselves be a form of managing the knowledge of how to perform bioinformatics analyses. Several systems now exist that offer support for the generation and collection of provenance information about how a particular in silico experiment was run, what results were generated, how they were generated, etc. In reviewing provenance support, we will review one of the important knowledge management issues in bioinformatics.},

The effective management of such experiments requires a specific set of cardinal facilities, such as experiment specification techniques, workflow derivation heuristics and provenance mechanisms. These facilities may characterise the experiment life cycle into three phases: composition, execution, and analysis. Works concerned with supporting scientific workflows are mainly concerned with the execution and analysis phase. Therefore, they fail to support the scientific experiment throughout its life cycle as a set of integrated experimentation technologies. In large scale experiments this represents a research challenge. We propose an approach for managing large scale experiments based on provenance gathering during all phases of the life cycle. We foresee that such approach may aid scientists to have more control on the trials of the scientific experiment.},

abstract = {Background: Technological advances in sequencing, assembly and segregation of resulting contigs into species-specific bins has enabled the reconstruction of individual genomes from environmental metagenomic data sets. Though a powerful technique, it is shadowed by an inability to truly determine whether assembly and binning techniques are accurate, specific, and sensitive due to a lack of complete reference genome sequences against which to check the data. Errors in genome reconstruction, such as missing or mis-attributed activities, can have a detrimental effect on downstream metabolic and ecological modeling, and thus it is important to assess the accuracy of the process.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMethods: We compared genomes reconstructed from metagenomic data to complete genome sequences of 10 organisms isolated from the same community to identify regions not captured by typical binning techniques. The nucleotide content, as {\%}G+C and tetranucleotide frequencies, and sequence redundancy within both the genome and across the metagenome were determined for both the captured and uncaptured regions. This direct comparison allowed us to evaluate the efficacy of nucleotide composition and coverage profiles as elements of binning protocols and look for biases in sequence characteristics and gene content in regions missing from the reconstructions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nResults: We found that repeated sequences were frequently missed in the reconstruction process as were short sequences with variant nucleotide composition. Genes encoded on the missing regions were strongly biased towards ribosomal RNAs, transfer RNAs, mobile element functions and genes of unknown function.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nConclusions: Our observation of increased mis-binning of short regions, especially those with variant nucleotide content, and repeated regions implies that factors which affect assembly efficiency also impact binning accuracy. To a large extent, mis-binned regions appear to derive from mobile elements. Our results support genome reconstruction as a robust process, and suggest that reconstructions determined to be {\textgreater}90{\%} complete are likely to effectively represent organismal function.},

abstract = {Summary Cyanobacteria of the genus Synechococcus are major contributors to global primary productivity and are found in a wide range of aquatic ecosystems. This Synechococcus collective (SC) is metabolically diverse, with some lineages thriving in polar and nutrient-rich locations and others in tropical or riverine waters. Although many studies have discussed the ecology and evolution of the SC, there is a paucity of knowledge on its taxonomic structure. Thus, we present a new taxonomic classification framework for the SC based on recent advances in microbial genomic taxonomy. Phylogenomic analyses of 1085 cyanobacterial genomes demonstrate that organisms classified as Synechococcus are polyphyletic at the order rank. The SC is classified into 15 genera, which are placed into five distinct orders within the phylum Cyanobacteria: i. Synechococcales (Cyanobium, Inmanicoccus, Lacustricoccus gen. nov., Parasynechococcus, Pseudosynechococcus, Regnicoccus, Synechospongium gen. nov., Synechococcus, and Vulcanococcus); ii. Cyanobacteriales (Limnothrix); iii. Leptococcales (Brevicoccus and Leptococcus); iv. Thermosynechococcales (Stenotopis and Thermosynechococcus), and v. Neosynechococcales (Neosynechococcus). The newly proposed classification is consistent with habitat distribution patterns (seawater, freshwater, brackish, and thermal environments) and reflects the ecological and evolutionary relationships of the SC.

abstract = {Background: We recently described FastTree, a tool for inferring phylogenies for alignments with up to hundreds of thousands of sequences. Here, we describe improvements to FastTree that improve its accuracy without sacrificing scalability. Methodology/Principal Findings: Where FastTree 1 used nearest-neighbor interchanges (NNIs) and the minimum-evolution criterion to improve the tree, FastTree 2 adds minimum-evolution subtree-pruning-regrafting (SPRs) and maximum-likelihood NNIs. FastTree 2 uses heuristics to restrict the search for better trees and estimates a rate of evolution for each site (the "CAT" approximation). Nevertheless, for both simulated and genuine alignments, FastTree 2 is slightly more accurate than a standard implementation of maximum-likelihood NNIs (PhyML 3 with default settings). Although FastTree 2 is not quite as accurate as methods that use maximum-likelihood SPRs, most of the splits that disagree are poorly supported, and for large alignments, FastTree 2 is 100-1,000 times faster. FastTree 2 inferred a topology and likelihood-based local support values for 237,882 distinct 16S ribosomal RNAs on a desktop computer in 22 hours and 5.8 gigabytes of memory.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Sequence similarity searching is a very important bioinformatics task. While Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics, the speed of the current BLAST software is suboptimal for very long queries or database sequences. There are also some shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line applications. RESULTS We describe features and improvements of rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run times. For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing CPU time and memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking information for database sequences from the BLAST databases. A new modular software library can now access subject sequence data from arbitrary data sources. We introduce several new features, including strategy files that allow a user to save and reuse their favorite set of options. The strategy files can be uploaded to and downloaded from the NCBI BLAST web site. CONCLUSION The new BLAST command-line applications, compared to the current BLAST tools, demonstrate substantial speed improvements for long queries as well as chromosome length database sequences. We have also improved the user interface of the command-line applications.},

Elements of the algorithm include fast distance estimation using kmer counting, progressive alignment using a new profile function we call the log-expectation score, and refinement using tree-dependent restricted partitioning. The speed and accuracy of MUSCLE are compared with T-Coffee, MAFFT and CLUSTALW on four test sets of reference alignments: BAliBASE, SABmark, SMART and a new benchmark, PREFAB. MUSCLE achieves the highest, or joint highest, rank in accuracy on each of these sets. Without refinement, MUSCLE achieves average accuracy statistically indistinguishable from T-Coffee and MAFFT, and is the fastest of the tested methods for large numbers of sequences, aligning 5000 sequences of average length 350 in 7 min on a current desktop computer.

With Prodigal, we focused specifically on the three goals of improved gene structure prediction, improved translation initiation site recognition, and reduced false positives. We compared the results of Prodigal to existing gene-finding methods to demonstrate that it met each of these objectives.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: We built a fast, lightweight, open source gene prediction program called Prodigal http://compbio.ornl.gov/prodigal/.

These new options of MAFFT showed higher accuracy than currently available methods including TCoffee version 2 and CLUSTAL W in benchmark tests consisting of alignments of {\textgreater}50 sequences. Like the previously available options, the new options of MAFFT can handle hundreds of sequences on a standard desktop computer. We also examined the effect of the number of homologues included in an alignment. For a multiple alignment consisting of ∼8 sequences with low similarity, the accuracy was improved (2-10 percentage points) when the sequences were aligned together with dozens of their close homologues (E-value {\textless} 10-5-10-20) collected from a database. Such improvement was generally observed for most methods, but remarkably large for the new options of MAFFT proposed here.

Here we present the novel metagenome classifier Kaiju, which finds maximum (in-)exact matches on the protein-level using the Burrows-Wheeler transform. We show in a genome exclusion benchmark that Kaiju classifies reads with higher sensitivity and similar precision compared with current k-mer-based classifiers, especially in genera that are underrepresented in reference databases. We also demonstrate that Kaiju classifies up to 10 times more reads in real metagenomes. Kaiju can process millions of reads per minute and can run on a standard PC.

As methods for detection and characterization of antimicrobial resistance move from targeted culture and polymerase chain reaction to high throughput metagenomics, appropriate resources for the analysis of large-scale data are required. Currently, antimicrobial resistance databases are tailored to smaller-scale, functional profiling of genes using highly descriptive annotations. Such characteristics do not facilitate the analysis of large-scale, ecological sequence datasets such as those produced with the use of metagenomics for surveillance. In order to overcome these limitations, we present MEGARes (https://megares.meglab.org), a hand-curated antimicrobial resistance database and annotation structure that provides a foundation for the development of high throughput acyclical classifiers and hierarchical statistical analysis of big data. MEGARes can be browsed as a stand-alone resource through the website or can be easily integrated into sequence analysis pipelines through download.

Whole-genome similarity metrics such as Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) help address this question by facilitating high resolution taxonomic analysis of thousands of genomes from diverse phylogenetic lineages. To scale to available genomes and beyond, we present FastANI, a new method to estimate ANI using alignment-free approximate sequence mapping. FastANI is accurate for both finished and draft genomes, and is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to alignment-based approaches. We leverage FastANI to compute pairwise ANI values among all prokaryotic genomes available in the NCBI database. Our results reveal clear genetic discontinuity, with 99.8{\%} of the total 8 billion genome pairs analyzed conforming to {\textgreater}95{\%} intra-species and {\textless}83{\%} inter-species ANI values. This discontinuity is manifested with or without the most frequently sequenced species, and is robust to historic additions in the genome databases.},

abstract = {The ranks higher than the species in the prokaryotic taxonomy are primarily designated based on phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences, but no definite standards exist for the absolute relatedness (measured by 16S rRNA or other means) between the ranks. Accordingly, it remains unknown how comparable the ranks are between different organisms. To gain insights into this question, we studied the relationship between shared gene content and genetic relatedness for 175 fully sequenced strains, using as a robust measure of relatedness the average amino acid identity (AAI) of the shared genes. Our results reveal that adjacent ranks (e.g., phylum versus class) frequently show extensive overlap in terms of genetic and gene content relatedness of the grouped organisms, and hence, the current system is of limited predictive power in this respect. The overlap between nonadjacent ranks (e.g., phylum versus family) is generally limited and attributable to clear inconsistencies of the taxonomy. In addition to providing means for standardizing taxonomy, our AAI-based approach provides a means to evaluate the robustness of alternative genetic markers for phylogenetic purposes. For instance, the 23S rRNA gene was found to be as good a marker as the 16S rRNA gene, while several of the widely distributed protein-coding genes, such as the RNA polymerase and gyrase subunits, show a strong phylogenetic signal, albeit less strong than the rRNA genes (0.78 {\textgreater} R2 {\textgreater} 0.69 for the protein-coding genes versus R2 = 0.84 for the rRNA genes). The AAI approach outlined here could contribute significantly to a genome-based taxonomy for all microbial organisms.},

The models assess cell abundance based on temperature and photosynthetically active radiation, but the indi- vidual responses to these environmental variables differ for each lineage. The models estimate global biogeographic patterns and seasonal variability of cell abundance, with maxima in the warm oligotrophic gyres of the Indian and the western Paci fi cOceans and minima at higher latitudes.

The changes are geographically uneven but include an increase in area.

The genetic diversity among Cyanobacteria enables them to thrive across many habitats, although only a few studies have analysed the association of phylogenomic clades to specific environmental niches. In this study, we adopted an ecogenomics strategy with the aim to delineate ecological niche preferences of Cyanobacteria and integrate them to the genomic taxonomy of these bacteria. First, an appropriate phylogenomic framework was established using a set of genomic taxonomy signatures (including a tree based on conserved gene sequences, genome-to-genome distance, and average amino acid identity) to analyse ninety-nine publicly available cyanobacterial genomes. Next, the relative abundances of these genomes were determined throughout diverse global marine and freshwater ecosystems, using metagenomic data sets. The whole-genome-based taxonomy of the ninety-nine genomes allowed us to identify 57 (of which 28 are new genera) and 87 (of which 32 are new species) different cyanobacterial genera and species, respectively. The ecogenomic analysis allowed the distinction of three major ecological groups of Cyanobacteria (named as i. Low Temperature; ii. Low Temperature Copiotroph; and iii. High Temperature Oligotroph) that were coherently linked to the genomic taxonomy. This work establishes a new taxonomic framework for Cyanobacteria in the light of genomic taxonomy and ecogenomic approaches.},

We analyzed the complete genomes of 13 cultured P. marinus type and reference strains by means of several genomic taxonomy tools (i.e., multilocus sequence analysis, amino acid identity, Karlin genomic signature, and genome to genome distance). In addition, we estimated the diversity of Prochlorococcus species in over 100 marine metagenomes from all the major oceanic provinces. According to our careful taxonomic analysis, the 13 strains corresponded, in fact, to ten different Prochlorococcus species. This analysis establishes a new taxonomic framework for the genus Prochlorococcus. Further, the analysis of the metagenomic data suggests that, in total, there may only be 35 Prochlorococcus species in the world's oceans.

Each species was then described on the basis of their gene content, light and nutrient utilization strategies, geographical distribution patterns throughout the oceans and response to environmental parameters.},

In this commentary paper, we discuss recent studies on the genomic taxonomy of diverse microbial groups and a unified species definition based on genomics. Accordingly, strains from the same microbial species share {\textgreater}95{\%} Average Amino Acid Identity (AAI) and Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI), {\textgreater}95{\%} identity based on multiple alignment genes, {\textless}10 in Karlin genomic signature, and {\textgreater} 70{\%} in silico Genome-to-Genome Hybridization similarity (GGDH). Species of the same genus will form monophyletic groups on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequences, Multilocus Sequence Analysis (MLSA) and supertree analysis. In addition to the established requirements for species descriptions, we propose that new taxa descriptions should also include at least a draft genome sequence of the type strain in order to obtain a clear outlook on the genomic landscape of the novel microbe. The application of the new genomic species definition put forward here will allow researchers to use genome sequences to define simultaneously coherent phenotypic and genomic groups.},

Taking examples from marine research, we summarize essential variables used to describe material sampling processes and sequencing procedures in a metagenomics experiment. These aspects of metagenomics dataset generation have been to some extent addressed by the scientific community, but greater awareness and adoption is still needed. We emphasize the lack of standards relating to reporting how metagenomics datasets are analysed and how the metagenomics data analysis outputs should be archived and published.

Basic data stewardship is still taught relatively rarely in life science education programmes, creating a chasm between theory and practice, and fuelling demand for bioinformatics training across all educational levels and career roles. Concerned by this, surveys have been conducted in recent years to monitor bioinformatics and computational training needs worldwide. This article briefly reviews the principal findings of a number of these studies. We see that there is still a strong appetite for short courses to improve expertise and confidence in data analysis and interpretation; strikingly, however, the most urgent appeal is for bioinformatics to be woven into the fabric of life science degree programmes. Satisfying the relentless training needs of current and future generations of life scientists will require a concerted response from stakeholders across the globe, who need to deliver sustainable solutions capable of both transforming education curricula and cultivating a new cadre of trainer scientists.},

Its vision of biology now realized, the molecular paradigm has run its course. Biology, therefore, has a choice to make, between the comfortable path of continuing to follow molecular biology's lead or the more invigorating one of seeking a new and inspiring vision of the living world, one that addresses the major problems in biology that 20th century biology, molecular biology, could not handle and, so, avoided. The former course, though highly productive, is certain to turn biology into an engineering discipline. The latter holds the promise of making biology an even more fundamental science, one that, along with physics, probes and defines the nature of reality.

The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straight-forward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences.

Among the most exciting advances are large-scale DNA sequencing efforts such as the Human Genome Project which are producing an immense amount of data. The need to understand the data is becoming ever more pressing. Demands for sophisticated analyses of biological sequences are driving forward the newly-created and explosively expanding research area of computational molecular biology, or bioinformatics. Many of the most powerful sequence analysis methods are now based on principles of probabilistic modelling. Examples of such methods include the use of probabilistically derived score matrices to determine the significance of sequence alignments, the use of hidden Markov models as the basis for profile searches to identify distant members of sequence families, and the inference of phylogenetic trees using maximum likelihood approaches. This book provides the first unified, up-to-date, and tutorial-level overview of sequence analysis methods, with particular emphasis on probabilistic modelling. Pairwise alignment, hidden Markov models, multiple alignment, profile searches, RNA secondary structure analysis, and phylogenetic inference are treated at length. Written by an interdisciplinary team of authors, the book is accessible to molecular biologists, computer scientists and mathematicians with n o formal knowledge of each others' fields. It presents the state-of-the-art in this important, new and rapidly developing discipline.},

abstract = {The interpretation of count data originating from the current generation of DNA sequencing platforms requires special attention. In particular, the per-sample library sizes often vary by orders of magnitude from the same sequencing run, and the counts are overdispersed relative to a simple Poisson model These challenges can be addressed using an appropriate mixture model that simultaneously accounts for library size differences and biological variability. This approach is already well-characterized and implemented for RNA-Seq data in R packages such as edgeR and DESeq. We use statistical theory, extensive simulations, and empirical data to show that variance stabilizing normalization using a mixture model like the negative binomial is appropriate for microbiome count data. In simulations detecting differential abundance, normalization procedures based on a Gamma-Poisson mixture model provided systematic improvement in performance over crude proportions or rarefied counts -- both of which led to a high rate of false positives. In simulations evaluating clustering accuracy, we found that the rarefying procedure discarded samples that were nevertheless accurately clustered by alternative methods, and that the choice of minimum library size threshold was critical in some settings, but with an optimum that is unknown in practice. Techniques that use variance stabilizing transformations by modeling microbiome count data with a mixture distribution, such as those implemented in edgeR and DESeq, substantially improved upon techniques that attempt to normalize by rarefying or crude proportions. Based on these results and well-established statistical theory, we advocate that investigators avoid rarefying altogether. We have provided microbiome-specific extensions to these tools in the R package, phyloseq.},

abstract = {Background: Technological advances in sequencing, assembly and segregation of resulting contigs into species-specific bins has enabled the reconstruction of individual genomes from environmental metagenomic data sets. Though a powerful technique, it is shadowed by an inability to truly determine whether assembly and binning techniques are accurate, specific, and sensitive due to a lack of complete reference genome sequences against which to check the data. Errors in genome reconstruction, such as missing or mis-attributed activities, can have a detrimental effect on downstream metabolic and ecological modeling, and thus it is important to assess the accuracy of the process.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMethods: We compared genomes reconstructed from metagenomic data to complete genome sequences of 10 organisms isolated from the same community to identify regions not captured by typical binning techniques. The nucleotide content, as {\%}G+C and tetranucleotide frequencies, and sequence redundancy within both the genome and across the metagenome were determined for both the captured and uncaptured regions. This direct comparison allowed us to evaluate the efficacy of nucleotide composition and coverage profiles as elements of binning protocols and look for biases in sequence characteristics and gene content in regions missing from the reconstructions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nResults: We found that repeated sequences were frequently missed in the reconstruction process as were short sequences with variant nucleotide composition. Genes encoded on the missing regions were strongly biased towards ribosomal RNAs, transfer RNAs, mobile element functions and genes of unknown function.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nConclusions: Our observation of increased mis-binning of short regions, especially those with variant nucleotide content, and repeated regions implies that factors which affect assembly efficiency also impact binning accuracy. To a large extent, mis-binned regions appear to derive from mobile elements. Our results support genome reconstruction as a robust process, and suggest that reconstructions determined to be {\textgreater}90{\%} complete are likely to effectively represent organismal function.},

Pharmacophylogenomics is a novel bioinformatics field that aims at reducing the time and the financial cost of the drug discovery process. Pharmacophylogenomic analyses are applied mainly in the early stages of the research phase in drug discovery. Pharmacophylogenomic analysis executes several bioinformatics programs in a coherent flow to identify homologues sequences, construct phylogenetic trees and execute evolutionary and structural experiments. This way, it can be modeled as scientific workflows. Pharmacophylogenomic analysis workflows are complex, computing and data intensive and may execute during weeks. This way, it benefits from parallel execution. We propose SciPPGx, a scientific workflow that aims at providing thorough inferring support for pharmacophylogenomic hypotheses. SciPPGx is executed in parallel in a cloud using SciCumulus workflow engine.

Both issues experienced an explosive growth in the last two decades due to massive generation of genomic data, novel statistical methods and computational approaches to process and analyze this large volume of data. Most experiments in molecular evolution are based on computing intensive simulations preceded by other computation tools and post-processed by computing validators. All these tools can be modeled as scientific workflows to improve the experiment management while capturing provenance data. However, these evolutionary analyses experiments are very complex and may execute for weeks. These workflows need to be executed in parallel in High Performance Computing (HPC) environments such as clouds. Clouds are becoming adopted for bioinformatics experiments due to its characteristics, such as, elasticity and availability. Clouds are evolving into HPC environments. In this paper, we introduce SciEvol, a bioinformatics scientific workflow for molecular evolution reconstruction that aims at inferring evolutionary relationships (i.e. to detect positive Darwinian selection) on genomic data. SciEvol is designed and implemented to execute in parallel over the clouds using SciCumulus workflow engine. Our experiments show that SciEvol can help scientists by enabling the reconstruction of evolutionary relationships using the cloud environment. Results present performance improvements of up to 94.64{\%} in the execution time when compared to the sequential execution, which drops from around 10 days to 12 hours. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

With the increased breadth of experimental designs now being pursued, project-specific statistical analyses are often needed, and these analyses are often difficult (or impossible) for peer researchers to independently reproduce. The vast majority of the requisite tools for performing these analyses reproducibly are already implemented in R and its extensions (packages), but with limited support for high throughput microbiome census data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here we describe a software project, phyloseq, dedicated to the object-oriented representation and analysis of microbiome census data in R. It supports importing data from a variety of common formats, as well as many analysis techniques. These include calibration, filtering, subsetting, agglomeration, multi-table comparisons, diversity analysis, parallelized Fast UniFrac, ordination methods, and production of publication-quality graphics; all in a manner that is easy to document, share, and modify. We show how to apply functions from other R packages to phyloseq-represented data, illustrating the availability of a large number of open source analysis techniques. We discuss the use of phyloseq with tools for reproducible research, a practice common in other fields but still rare in the analysis of highly parallel microbiome census data.

abstract = {Marker-gene and metagenomic sequencing have profoundly expanded our ability to measure biological communities. But the measurements they provide differ from the truth, often dramatically, because these experiments are biased toward detecting some taxa over others. This experimental bias makes the taxon or gene abundances measured by different protocols quantitatively incomparable and can lead to spurious biological conclusions. We propose a mathematical model for how bias distorts community measurements based on the properties of real experiments. We validate this model with 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomics data from defined bacterial communities. Our model better fits the experimental data despite being simpler than previous models. We illustrate how our model can be used to evaluate protocols, to understand the effect of bias on downstream statistical analyses, and to measure and correct bias given suitable calibration controls. These results illuminate new avenues toward truly quantitative and reproducible metagenomics measurements.},

There is increasing awareness that microbiome datasets generated by HTS are compositional because they have an arbitrary total imposed by the instrument. However, many investigators are either unaware of this or assume specific properties of the compositional data. The purpose of this review is to alert investigators to the dangers inherent in ignoring the compositional nature of the data, and point out that HTS datasets derived from microbiome studies can and should be treated as compositions at all stages of analysis. We briefly introduce compositional data, illustrate the pathologies that occur when compositional data are analyzed inappropriately, and finally give guidance and point to resources and examples for the analysis of microbiome datasets using compositional data analysis.},

abstract = {Taxonomy is an organizing principle of biology and is ideally based on evolutionary relationships among organisms. Development of a robust bacterial taxonomy has been hindered by an inability to obtain most bacteria in pure culture and, to a lesser extent, by the historical use of phenotypes to guide classification. Culture-independent sequencing technologies have matured sufficiently that a comprehensive genome-based taxonomy is now possible. We used a concatenated protein phylogeny as the basis for a bacterial taxonomy that conservatively removes polyphyletic groups and normalizes taxonomic ranks on the basis of relative evolutionary divergence. Under this approach, 58{\%} of the 94,759 genomes comprising the Genome Taxonomy Database had changes to their existing taxonomy. This result includes the description of 99 phyla, including six major monophyletic units from the subdivision of the Proteobacteria, and amalgamation of the Candidate Phyla Radiation into a single phylum. Our taxonomy should enable improved classification of uncultured bacteria and provide a sound basis for ecological and evolutionary studies.},

As sequencing costs have dropped, thousands of new genomes have been sequenced, and scientists have come to realize that a single reference genome is inadequate for many purposes. By sampling a diverse set of individuals, one can begin to assemble a pan-genome: a collection of all the DNA sequences that occur in a species. Here we review efforts to create pan-genomes for a range of species, from bacteria to humans, and we further consider the computational methods that have been proposed in order to capture, interpret and compare pan-genome data. As scientists continue to survey and catalogue the genomic variation across human populations and begin to assemble a human pan-genome, these efforts will increase our power to connect variation to human diversity, disease and beyond.},

abstract = {Background: The development of e-Science presents a major set of opportunities and challenges for the future progress of biological and life scientific research. Major new tools are required and corresponding demands are placed on the high-throughput data generated and used in these processes. Nowhere is the demand greater than in the semantic integration of these data. Semantic Web tools and technologies afford the chance to achieve this semantic integration. Since pathway knowledge is central to much of the scientific research today it is a good test-bed for semantic integration. Within the context of biological pathways, the BioPAX initiative, part of a broader movement towards the standardization and integration of life science databases, forms a necessary prerequisite for its successful application of e-Science in health care and life science research. This paper examines whether BioPAX, an effort to overcome the barrier of disparate and heterogeneous pathway data sources, addresses the needs of e-Science. Results: We demonstrate how BioPAX pathway data can be used to ask and answer some useful biological questions. We find that BioPAX comes close to meeting a broad range of e-Science needs, but certain semantic weaknesses mean that these goals are missed. We make a series of recommendations for re-modeling some aspects of BioPAX to better meet these needs. Conclusion: Once these semantic weaknesses are addressed, it will be possible to integrate pathway information in a manner that would be useful in e-Science. {\textcopyright} 2007 Luciano and Stevens; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {E-science experiments typically involve many distributed services maintained by different organisations. After an experiment has been executed, it is useful for a scientist to verify that the execution was performed correctly or is compatible with some existing experimental criteria or standards, not necessarily anticipated prior to execution. Scientists may also want to review and verify experiments performed by their colleagues. There are no existing frameworks for validating such experiments in today's e-science systems. Users therefore have to rely on error checking performed by the services, or adopt other ad hoc methods. This paper introduces a platform-independent framework for validating workflow executions. The validation relies on reasoning over the documented provenance of experiment results and semantic descriptions of services advertised in a registry. This validation process ensures experiments are performed correctly, and thus results generated are meaningful. The framework is tested in a bioinformatics application that performs protein compressibility analysis. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {During the last decades, there is a vast data explosion in bioinformatics. Big data centres are trying to face this data crisis, reaching high storage capacity levels. Although several scientific giants examine how to handle the enormous pile of information in their cupboards, the problem remains unsolved. On a daily basis, there is a massive quantity of permanent loss of extensive information due to infrastructure and storage space problems. The motivation for sequencing has fallen behind. Sometimes, the time that is spent to solve storage space problems is longer than the one dedicated to collect and analyse data. To bring sequencing to the foreground, scientists have to slide over such obstacles and find alternative ways to approach the issue of data volume. Scientific community experiences the data crisis era, where, out of the box solutions may ease the typical research workflow, until technological development meets the needs of Bioinformatics.},

abstract = {Until not long ago, manually capturing and storing provenance from scientific experiments were constant concerns for scientists. With the advent of computational experiments (modeled as scientific workflows) and ScientificWorkflow Management Systems, produced and consumed data, as well as the provenance of a given experiment, are automatically managed, so provenance capturing and storing in such a context is no longer a major concern. Similarly to several existing big data problems, the bottom line is now on how to analyze the large amounts of provenance data generated by workflow executions and how to be able to extract useful knowledge of this data. In this context, this article surveys the current state of the art on provenance analytics by presenting the key initiatives that have been taken to support provenance data analysis.We also contribute by proposing a taxonomy to classify elements related to provenance analytics.},

@article{Yuan2018,
abstract = {Science is conducted collaboratively, often requiring the sharing of knowledge about computational experiments. When experiments include only datasets, they can be shared using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) or Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). An experiment, however, seldom includes only datasets, but more often includes software, its past execution, provenance, and associated documentation. The Research Object has recently emerged as a comprehensive and systematic method for aggregation and identification of diverse elements of computational experiments. While a necessary method, mere aggregation is not sufficient for the sharing of computational experiments. Other users must be able to easily recompute on these shared research objects. Computational provenance is often the key to enable such reuse. In this paper, we show how reusable research objects can utilize provenance to correctly repeat a previous reference execution, to construct a subset of a research object for partial reuse, and to reuse existing contents of a research object for modified reuse. We describe two methods to summarize provenance that aid in understanding the contents and past executions of a research object. The first method obtains a process-view by collapsing low-level system information, and the second method obtains a summary graph by grouping related nodes and edges with the goal to obtain a graph view similar to application workflow. Through detailed experiments, we show the efficacy and efficiency of our algorithms.},

abstract = {Here we present a standard developed by the Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC) for reporting marker gene sequences-the minimum information about a marker gene sequence (MIMARKS). We also introduce a system for describing the environment from which a biological sample originates. The 'environmental packages' apply to any genome sequence of known origin and can be used in combination with MIMARKS and other GSC checklists. Finally, to establish a unified standard for describing sequence data and to provide a single point of entry for the scientific community to access and learn about GSC checklists, we present the minimum information about any (x) sequence (MIxS). Adoption of MIxS will enhance our ability to analyze natural genetic diversity documented by massive DNA sequencing efforts from myriad ecosystems in our ever-changing biosphere.},
